# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to NodeChain. It's people like you that make NodeChain better.

When contributing to NodeChain, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Your First Contribution

If this is your first time contributing to the project, and you don't want to commit, there are other tasks you can do to be a hero:

- Review a [Pull Request](https://github.com/swapper-org/NodeChain/pulls).
- Fix an [Issue](https://github.com/swapper-org/NodeChain/issues).
- Update the [docs](https://docs.nodechain.swapper.market).
- Write a tutorial.
- Enhance the project's identity.
- Spread the project.

## Contributing to development

### Issue Process

Have you noticed any **bugs** or have any **feature** requests? You can submit any request [here](https://github.com/swapper-org/NodeChain/issues/new).

It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Pull Request Process

We use forking to contributing the project.

For more information, you can check this [Git guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) about forking.

#### Fork & Create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, improve or add, then [fork NodeChain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue **#123** is the issue you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 123-support-bitcoin-cash-rpc-api
```

#### Get your project running

Before you start coding, you need to test if your project is running in your machine.
Check out the [README](https://github.com/swapper-org/NodeChain/blob/master/README.md) to warm up and set up the project.

#### Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help, everyone is a beginner at first.

#### Run lint and tests

Before submitting a pull request, make sure your changes don't break any functionality of the project. Check out the [README](https://github.com/swapper-org/NodeChain/blob/master/README.md) to see how can you do it.

#### Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your staging branch and make sure it's up to date with NodeChain's staging branch:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:swapper-org/NodeChain.git
git checkout staging
git pull upstream staging
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of staging, and push it!

```sh
git checkout 123-support-bitcoin-cash-rpc-api
git rebase staging
git push --set-upstream origin 123-support-bitcoin-cash-rpc-api
```

Finally, go to GitHub and make a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) ðŸ˜„

#### Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

To learn more about rebasing in Git, there are a lot of good resources as [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) or [Git-SCM docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing), but here's the suggested workflow:

```sh
git checkout 123-support-bitcoin-cash-rpc-api
git pull --rebase upstream staging
git push --force-with-lease 123-support-bitcoin-cash-rpc-api
```

### Merging a PR (maintainers only)

A PR can only be merged into staging by a maintainer if:

- It is passing CI.
- It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If it was a maintainer who opened the PR, only one extra approval is needed.
- It has no requested changes.
- It is up to date with current staging.

A PR can only be merged from staging into master by a maintainer if:

- It is passing CI.
- It is approved to move to the next production version by the rest of the maintainers.
- It has the documentation up to date.
- It is up to date with current master.

Any maintainer is allowed to merge a PR if all of these conditions are met.

### Releases (maintainers only)

Currently, NodeChain is using a versioning based on two digits (**vX.Y**).
Where **"X"** is **Production stage** version (master branch) and **"Y"** is **Staging/Test stage** version (staging branch).

This may change for minor changes This may change for minor changes and hotfixes, where a three-digit versioning will be used (**vX.Y.Z**).
Where **"Z"** is **Staging stage** version with the **hotfix** (staging branch)

This may change and improve in the future.

## Contributing to documentation

Our Swagger documentation is in the [NodeChain docs](https://github.com/swapper-org/NodeChain-docs) repository.
It is divided by **master branch versions**.

### Fork and create branch

If our branch **#123** in NodeChain repository is making any changes in the documentation, then [fork NodeChain docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) and create a branch with the same name.

```sh
git checkout -b 123-support-bitcoin-cash-rpc-api
```

### Make the changes

Now you can make any necessary changes in the documentation, remember to ask for help if you need it!

### Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your staging branch and make sure it's up to date with NodeChain-docs's staging branch:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:swapper-org/NodeChain-docs.git
git checkout staging
git pull upstream staging
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of staging, and push it!

```sh
git checkout 123-support-bitcoin-cash-rpc-api
git rebase staging
git push --set-upstream origin 123-support-bitcoin-cash-rpc-api
```

Finally, go to GitHub and make a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) ðŸ˜„

### Link your docs PR to the main PR

Once you make your Pull Request in NodeChain-docs, copy the link and add it to your Pull Request in NodeChain repository.
There is a section called "Related PR or Docs PR" to paste it!
